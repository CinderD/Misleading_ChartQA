  "explanation": "The overall trend line shows a negative relationship across both departments combined, suggesting more training leads to lower productivity. However, this aggregated view cannot determine the relationship within each individual department. Department A and Department B may have different work processes, skill requirements, or productivity measurement methods that create different training-productivity relationships within each department. The combined trend line inappropriately aggregates data from distinct organizational units."

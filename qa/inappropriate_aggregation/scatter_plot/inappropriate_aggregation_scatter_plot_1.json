  "explanation": "The chart shows aggregated data from both schools with an overall negative trend line, which might mislead viewers to think this relationship exists within each school. However, the individual school-level relationships cannot be determined from this aggregated visualization. School A might have a negative correlation, School B might have a positive correlation, or both might have different patterns than the overall trend suggests. This is a classic example of inappropriate aggregation where the combined trend masks the individual group patterns."

  "explanation": "The overall trend line shows a negative relationship across both companies combined, but this aggregated view cannot tell us about the relationship within each individual company. Company A employees might have different satisfaction patterns than Company B employees due to different corporate cultures, career paths, or compensation structures. The combined trend line inappropriately aggregates data from distinct groups and may not represent the true within-company relationships."

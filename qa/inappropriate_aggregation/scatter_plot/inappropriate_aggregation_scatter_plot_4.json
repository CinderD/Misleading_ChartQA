  "explanation": "The overall trend line shows a positive relationship across both cities combined, but this aggregated view cannot determine the relationship within each individual city. City A and City B may have different housing markets, cost of living, or economic structures that create different income-housing cost relationships within each city. The combined trend line inappropriately aggregates data from distinct urban markets and may not represent the true within-city relationships."

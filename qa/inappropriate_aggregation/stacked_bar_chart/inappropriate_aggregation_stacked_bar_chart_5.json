  "explanation": "This chart presents annual R&D investment data with 2024 showing only partial-year results (as of May 2024, representing approximately 5 months or 42% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete 2024 data with complete annual data from previous years. While all divisions appear to show reduced investment in 2024, this is simply because only the first five months are included. R&D investments are often allocated and spent unevenly throughout the year, with major project funding decisions frequently made later in the fiscal year."

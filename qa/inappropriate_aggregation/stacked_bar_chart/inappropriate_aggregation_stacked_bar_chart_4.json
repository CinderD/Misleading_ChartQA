  "explanation": "This chart displays annual employee training hours with 2024 showing only partial-year data (as of April 2024, representing approximately 4 months or 33% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation compares incomplete 2024 data with complete annual data from previous years. While 2024 appears to show significantly reduced training investment across all categories, this is misleading because only the first four months are included. Training programs often have seasonal patterns, with many organizations scheduling intensive training later in the year."

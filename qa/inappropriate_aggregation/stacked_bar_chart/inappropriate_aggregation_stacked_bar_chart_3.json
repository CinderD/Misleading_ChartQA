  "explanation": "This chart shows annual revenue data with 2024 displaying only partial-year data (as of March 2024, representing approximately 3 months or 25% of the year). The misleading aggregation inappropriately compares incomplete 2024 data with full-year data from previous years. While 2024 appears to show dramatically lower performance, this is simply because only the first quarter is included. Making predictions about full-year 2024 performance based on this incomplete aggregated data is inappropriate and misleading."

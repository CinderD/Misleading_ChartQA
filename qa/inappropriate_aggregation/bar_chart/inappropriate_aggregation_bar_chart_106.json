  "question": "Based on the weekly energy usage trend analysis shown in the chart, what is the expected weekly average energy consumption for the complete week?",
  "options": {
    "A": "44.0 kWh (as shown by the weekly average line)",
    "B": "The weekly average will be higher than 44.0 kWh",
    "C": "The weekly average will be lower than 44.0 kWh",
    "D": "Cannot be determined from the available data"

  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "True",
  "explanation": "The chart shows data only through Thursday (4 out of 7 days) and labels the average of these 4 days as 'Weekly Average', which is misleading. Since weekend data is still being collected, we cannot determine the true weekly average. The displayed 44.0 kWh represents only the Monday-Thursday average, not a complete weekly average. Weekend energy usage patterns might be significantly different from weekday patterns."

  "explanation": "This area chart shows annual employee recruitment data with 2022 displaying only partial-year results (as of May 01, 2022, representing approximately 4 months or 33% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete 2022 data (420 new employees in 4 months) with complete annual data from previous years. While 2022 appears to show a sharp decline in recruitment, this is simply because only the first four months are included. We cannot determine if there was actually a decline without the complete year's data."

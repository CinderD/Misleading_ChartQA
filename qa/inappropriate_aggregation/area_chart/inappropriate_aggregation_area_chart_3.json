  "explanation": "This area chart displays annual energy consumption data with 2024 showing only partial-year results (as of June 30, 2024, representing exactly 6 months or 50% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete 2024 data (1,820 MWh for 6 months) with complete annual data from previous years. While 2024 appears to show a significant decrease in energy consumption, this is simply because only half the year is included. Energy consumption often varies seasonally, and mid-year performance cannot indicate annual efficiency improvements."

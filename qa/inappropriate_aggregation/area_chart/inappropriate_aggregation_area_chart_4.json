  "explanation": "This area chart displays annual customer satisfaction data with 2024 showing only partial-year results (as of August 15, 2024, representing approximately 7.5 months or 63% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete 2024 data (5.4 satisfaction score for 7.5 months) with complete annual data from previous years. While 2024 appears to show a significant decline in customer satisfaction, this is simply because only about two-thirds of the year is included. Customer satisfaction can vary throughout the year due to seasonal factors, product launches, or service changes."

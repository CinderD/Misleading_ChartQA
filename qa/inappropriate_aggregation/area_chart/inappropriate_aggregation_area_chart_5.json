  "explanation": "This area chart displays annual R&D investment data with 2024 showing only partial-year results (as of September 10, 2024, representing approximately 8.5 months or 71% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete 2024 data ($255M for 8.5 months) with complete annual data from previous years. While 2024 appears to show reduced investment compared to 2023, this is simply because only about three-quarters of the year is included. R&D investments are often allocated unevenly throughout the year, with major funding decisions and project approvals frequently occurring in the final quarter."

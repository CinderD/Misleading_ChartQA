  "explanation": "This line chart displays annual board game sales data with 2022 showing only partial-year results (as of Jun 01, 2022, representing approximately 5 months or 42% of the year). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete 2022 data (1,000 copies sold in 5 months) with complete annual data from previous years. While 2022 appears to show a sharp decline in sales, this is simply because only about five months are included. Board game sales often have seasonal patterns, and mid-year performance cannot indicate annual sales trends."

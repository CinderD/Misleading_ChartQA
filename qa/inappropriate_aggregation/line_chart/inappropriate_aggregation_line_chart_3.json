  "question": "According to the chart, which statement best describes the company's competitive position?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Market share has been consistently growing from 2020 through 2023.",
    "B": "The company lost significant market share in Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023, potential indicating competitive challenges.",
    "C": "Market share growth has accelerated in recent quarters through early 2024.",

  "explanation": "This line chart displays quarterly market share data with Q1 2024 showing only partial-quarter results (as of Feb 15, 2024, representing about 1.5 months of the 3-month quarter). The inappropriate aggregation misleadingly compares incomplete Q1 2024 data (15.2% market share for 1.5 months) with complete quarterly data from previous periods. While Q1 2024 appears to show a dramatic decline, this is simply because only half the quarter is included. The correct answer focuses on the clear trend visible in complete data (2020-2023), avoiding the misleading incomplete 2024 data."

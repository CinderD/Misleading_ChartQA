  "question": "Looking at this choropleth map, which statement below is the most accurate?",
  "options": {
    "A": "State A and State B have very similar values.",
    "B": "The value gap between State A and State B might exceed that between State J and State B.",
    "C": "All three States (A,B,J) have very diverse values.",
    "D": "The value differences are impossible to determine from this visualization."
  },
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "categorical_encoding_for_continous_data",
  "chartType": "choropleth_map",
  "task": "Make Comparisons",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "State A (30) and State B (45) have a 15-point difference, while State B (45) and State J (55) have a 10-point difference. However, the categorical color encoding groups A and B into the same color bin (25-50 range), making their difference appear similar, while B and J appear more different due to different color bins."

  "question": "Looking at the US population map, which statement below is the most accurate?",
  "options": {
    "A": "The population between Texas and California are similar.",
    "B": "The population gap between California and Texas might exceeds that between Texas and Florida.",
    "C": "The three states (Texas, California, Florida) have very diverse population levels.",
    "D": "The population differences are impossible to determine from this visualization."
  },
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "categorical_encoding_for_continous_data",
  "chartType": "choropleth_map",
  "task": "Compare Values",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "California (39.5M) and Texas (30.1M) have a 9.4M population difference, while Texas (30.1M) and Florida (27.5M) have only a 2.6M difference. However, the categorical color encoding groups California and Texas into the same color bin (30M+ range), making their large difference appear similar, while Texas and Florida appear more different due to different color bins."

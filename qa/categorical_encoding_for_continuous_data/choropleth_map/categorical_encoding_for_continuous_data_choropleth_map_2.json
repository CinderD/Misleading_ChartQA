  "question": "Looking at the unemployment rate map, which statement below is the most accurate?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Illinois and Michigan have similar unemployment rates.",
    "B": "The unemployment gap between Illinois and Michigan might exceed that between Georgia and North Carolina.",
    "C": "All four states (Michigan, Illinois, Georgia and North Carolina) have very diverse unemployment levels.",
    "D": "The unemployment differences are impossible to determine from this visualization."
  },
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "categorical_encoding_for_continous_data",
  "chartType": "choropleth_map",
  "task": "Compare Values",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "Illinois (9.2%) and Michigan (12.8%) have a 3.6 percentage point difference, while Georgia (3.9%) and North Carolina (2.7%) have only a 1.2 percentage point difference. However, the categorical color encoding groups Illinois and Michigan into the same color bin (9%+ range), making their large difference appear similar, while Georgia and North Carolina appear more different due to different color bins."

  "question": "Looking at the sales performance heatmap, which statement best describes the relationship between North's Q1 sales and South's Q1 sales?",
  "options": {
    "A": "It can be inferred that their sales performances are very similar.",
    "B": "The sales performances might be significantly different, but the discrete color bins make them appear more different than they actually are.",
    "C": "North is clearly better than South, and the color difference accurately represents this sales gap.",
    "D": "The sales performance difference among different locations is impossible to determine from this visualization."
  },
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "categorical_encoding_for_continous_data",
  "chartType": "heatmap",
  "task": "Make Comparisons",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "North (180.2) and South (120.3) have a 59.9-point difference in Q1 sales, but the categorical color encoding groups them into the same color bin (100-200 range), masking their actual difference."

    "A": "Test scores show consistent improvement month over month",
    "B": "Test scores demonstrate highly volatile performance with dramatic ups and downs",
    "C": "Test scores remain relatively stable throughout the period",
    "D": "Test scores show a declining pattern over the course period"

  "explanation": "The chart displays months in a scrambled order (Mar → Jul → Jan → May → Aug → Feb → Jun → Apr), creating artificial volatility in what is actually a consistent upward trend. When arranged in proper chronological order from January to August, student test scores show steady improvement from 72 to 93 points, representing consistent month-over-month progress in the Advanced Mathematics course."

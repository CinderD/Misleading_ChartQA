  "explanation": "The chart displays months in reverse chronological order (Dec to Jan), making the naturally increasing sales trend appear as a decreasing trend. In reality, when arranged in proper chronological order, TechCorp's sales show consistent growth from 2,100 units in January to 4,200 units in December, representing a 100% increase over the year."

    "A": "Sales has the largest workforce among all categories.",
    "B": "Engineering has the largest workforce at 35.2%.",
    "C": "Sales and Marketing combined employ more than 60% of the workforce.",
    "D": "Operations employs about half of Marketing' workforce."

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "Labels show Engineering at 35.2% (largest), so B is correct. The pie slices use visual sizes that don't match the percentagesâ€”Sales' slice appears largest but its actual share is only 28.7%, making A a tempting but misleading choice. "

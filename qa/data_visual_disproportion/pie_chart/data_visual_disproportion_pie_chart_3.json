  "question": "The chart shows customer satisfaction levels. Which statement is correct according to the chart data?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Very Satisfied has the highest satisfaction level among all categories.",
    "B": "Neutral customers represent about half of Satisfied customers. ",
    "C": "Neutral and Dissatisfied combined represent over 25% of customers.",
    "D": "Satisfied has the highest percentage at 42.3%."

  "task": "Identify Values",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "Labels show Satisfied at 42.3% (highest), so D is correct. The pie slices use visual sizes that don't match the percentagesâ€”Neutral's slice appears large but its actual percentage is only 12.8%, making B a tempting but misleading choice."

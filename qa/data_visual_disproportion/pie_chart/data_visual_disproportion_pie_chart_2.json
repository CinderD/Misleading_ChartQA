  "question": "The chart shows budget allocation by department. Which statement is correct according to the chart data?",
  "options": {
    "A": "R&D has the largest budget among all departments.",
    "B": "Marketing has the largest budget at 32.5%.",
    "C": "Sales and Marketing combined receive less than 50% of the budget.",
    "D": "Operations receives about one-third of Sales' budget."
  },
  "correctAnswer": "B",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "data_visual_disproportion",
  "chartType": "pie_chart",
  "task": "Identify Values",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "Labels show Marketing at 32.5% (largest), so B is correct. The pie slices use visual sizes that don't match the percentagesâ€”R&D's slice appears largest but its actual allocation is only 22.1%, making A a tempting but misleading choice."

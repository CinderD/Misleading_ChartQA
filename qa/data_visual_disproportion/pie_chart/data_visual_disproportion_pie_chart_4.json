    "A": "Product Sales has the largest revenue share at 52.8%.",
    "B": "Licensing has the largest revenue share among all categories.",
    "C": "Services and Product Sales combined account for nearly 50% of revenue.",
    "D": "Consulting represents about double of Licensing's revenue."

  "explanation": "Labels show Product Sales at 52.8% (largest), so A is correct. The pie slices use visual sizes that don't match the percentagesâ€”Licensing's slice appears largest but its actual share is only 12.3%, making B a tempting but misleading choice. "

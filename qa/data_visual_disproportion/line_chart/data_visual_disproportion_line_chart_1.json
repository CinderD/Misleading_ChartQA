    "A": "The market share in 2023 shows dramatic growth compared to the growth in 2022.",
    "B": "The market share in 2021 is much higher than in 2018.",
    "C": "The market share in 2019 is 18.5%.",
    "D": "The market share growth from 2018 to 2023 is over 10 percentage points."

  "explanation": "The data shows 2023 market share (24.0%) is higher than 2020 (18.5%), so B is correct. The visual representation shows a dramatic spike in 2023 due to the height value being 35.0 instead of 24.0, making A a tempting but misleading choice. C is false (16.8%). D is false (growth is only 8.8 percentage points, not over 10)."

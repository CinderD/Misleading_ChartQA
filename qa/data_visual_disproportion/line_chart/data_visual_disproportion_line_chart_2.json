    "C": "The revenue in Q1 2022 is 13.2 million dollars.",

  "explanation": "The data shows Q2 2023 revenue (15.8M) is higher than Q3 2022 (13.8M), so B is correct. The visual representation shows a dramatic spike in Q2 2023 due to the height value being 25.0 instead of 15.8, making A a tempting but misleading choice. C is false (12.5M). D is false (growth is only 3.3M, not over 4M)."

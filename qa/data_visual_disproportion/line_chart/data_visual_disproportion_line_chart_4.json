    "A": "The traffic in Week 6 shows dramatic recovery compared to Week 5.",
    "B": "The traffic in Week 6 is the lowest among all weeks.",
    "C": "The traffic in Week 4 is higher than in Week 3.",
    "D": "The traffic decline from Week 1 to Week 6 is less than 5 thousand visitors."

  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The data shows Week 6 traffic is 78.2K, so B is correct. The visual representation shows a dramatic spike in Week 6 due to the height value being 95.0 instead of 78.2, making A a tempting but misleading choice. C is false (80.8K < 82.1K). D is false (decline is 7K, not less than 5K)."

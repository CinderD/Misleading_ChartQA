  "options": {
    "A": "Clothing's preference is roughly two times Cards.",
    "B": "Dining Out and Flowers differ by less than 1%.",
    "C": "Cards is less popular than Jewelry.",
    "D": "Gift Card is higher than Clothing."

  "misleader": "data_visual_disproportion",

  "task": "Identify Values",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "Labels show Dining Out 34.6% vs Flowers 34.3% (difference 0.3%), so B is correct. The dots' vertical positions are intentionally disproportionate—e.g., Cards is drawn very low while Candy is drawn high—so A or C may look plausible. Gift Card (12.6%) is below Clothing (14.4%), so D is false."

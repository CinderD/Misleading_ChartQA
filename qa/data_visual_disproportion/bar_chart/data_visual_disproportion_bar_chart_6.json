    "A": "Vietnam produces more than double of Colombia's output.",
    "B": "Indonesia produces more than Colombia.",
    "C": "Ethiopia has the smallest production among the listed countries.",
    "D": "Brazil and Vietnam produce about the same amount."

  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "According to labels: Ethiopia 0.6M (smallest) so C is correct. Visual bar heights are intentionally non-proportional; Vietnam (2.1M) looks far taller than Colombia (1.2M) and might be perceived as double (A), but the ratio is ~1.75Ã—. Colombia (1.2M) actually exceeds Indonesia (0.9M), so B is false. Brazil (3.8M) is much larger than Vietnam (2.1M), so D is false."

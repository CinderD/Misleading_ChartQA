  "explanation": "The bar chart clearly shows that Candidate 5 received the smallest percentage of votes (2.9%), indicating option C as correct. The visual disproportion of bars suggests otherwise. Option B appears plausible due to the misleading lengths of the bars though it is incorrect, as Candidate 2 only has 9.4% of the votes."

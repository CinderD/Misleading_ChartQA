  "explanation": "The chart shows products sold for January (100), February (200), and March (150). The correct average is (100 + 200 + 150) / 3 = 150. However, the misleading annotation shows a dashed line labeled 'Average' at 50, which is incorrect and designed to mislead viewers into selecting 50 as the answer."

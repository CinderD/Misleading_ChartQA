  "explanation": "The chart shows sales for April (250), May (450), and June (350). The correct average is (250 + 450 + 350) / 3 = 350. However, the misleading annotation shows a dashed line labeled 'Average' at 250, which is incorrect and designed to mislead viewers into selecting 250 as the answer."

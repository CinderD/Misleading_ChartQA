  "explanation": "The chart shows visitors for July (200), August (400), and September (300). The correct average is (200 + 400 + 300) / 3 = 300. However, the misleading annotation shows a dashed line labeled 'Average' at 200, which is incorrect and designed to mislead viewers into selecting 200 as the answer."

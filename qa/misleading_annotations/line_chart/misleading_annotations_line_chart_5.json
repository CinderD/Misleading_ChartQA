    "B": "Its monthly performance is declining from Jan to Dec.",
    "C": "Its monthly performance shows similar trends to Product A throughout the year.",
    "D": "Product B consistently outperforms Product A in performance."

  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart shows that Product B's performance is declining from 2800 in January to 1000 in December, which is a clear downward trend. Therefore, Product B's performance is declining, not improving. The misleading aspect is that the question focuses on Product B when viewers might be confused by the visual prominence of the lines or the title."

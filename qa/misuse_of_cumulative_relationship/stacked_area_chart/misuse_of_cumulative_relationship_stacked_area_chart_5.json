    "A": "Q4 shows the strongest performance with the highest total area.",
    "B": "Q1 shows the strongest performance with balanced metrics.",
    "C": "The chart cannot determine overall performance because it combines unrelated student metrics.",
    "D": "Q3 shows the strongest performance with the highest library book count."

  "question": "For the online platform, which interpretation best reflects what can (and cannot) be inferred from the 100% stacked bar chart?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Q1 has the highest number of online searches compared to the other quarters.",
    "B": "The sum of clicks and searches indicates user satisfaction trends across the year.",
    "C": "Complaints received are greater than online searches for every quarter.",
    "D": "Q4 has the highest number of advertisements clicked compared to the other quarters."

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "100% stacking normalizes unrelated categories (clicks, complaints, searches) to 100% within each quarter. Valid inferences include within-quarter ranking (e.g., complaints > searches in every quarter). Invalid inferences include cross-quarter total comparisons or combining unrelated categories."

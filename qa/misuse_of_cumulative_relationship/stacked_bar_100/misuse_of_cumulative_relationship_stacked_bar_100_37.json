  "explanation": "In a 100% stacked chart, unrelated indicators are normalized within each quarter. The share of complaints increases from Q1 to Q4, indicating a rising proportion; however, since the chart does not provide absolute quantities, one cannot conclude that the number of complaints increased each quarter, nor can total amounts be compared across quarters."

  "question": "Which statement is best supported by the 100% stacked chart about statistics across quarters?",
  "options": {
    "A": "The absolute amount of Music Downloads increases from Q1 to Q3 and then decreases in Q4.",
    "B": "Music Downloads increase steadily in absolute terms across all quarters.",
    "C": "In Q2, Water Usage is more than twice the value of Product Reviews in absolute terms.",
    "D": "Adding Music Downloads and Product Reviews yields a reliable engagement index across quarters."
  },
  "correctAnswer": "C",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "misuse_of_cumulative_relationship",
  "chartType": "stacked_bar_100",
  "task": "Find Correlations/Trends",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart shows share proportions: Music Downloadsâ€™ share rises from Q1 to Q3, then declines in Q4. Since a 100% stacked chart does not provide absolute totals, changes in share cannot be interpreted as increases or decreases in the actual number of downloads, nor can unrelated categories be added together."

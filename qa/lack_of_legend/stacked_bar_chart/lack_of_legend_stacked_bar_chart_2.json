  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart displays annual customer distribution data with different colored segments, but provides no legend to identify which geographic region each color represents. While the visual data clearly shows which colored segment has the largest customer base in 2023, without knowing which region each color corresponds to, it is impossible to determine which specific geographic region has the largest customer base. Regional color assignments without proper labeling are unreliable for market analysis."

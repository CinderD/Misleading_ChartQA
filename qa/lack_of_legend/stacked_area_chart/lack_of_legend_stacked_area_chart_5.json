  "explanation": "The chart displays population education level distribution with different colored areas, but provides no legend to identify what each color represents in terms of education categories. While the visual data shows the relative sizes of different colored areas, without knowing which education level each color corresponds to, it is impossible to determine the specific percentage of people with college education. Color interpretations without proper labeling are speculative and unreliable for demographic analysis."

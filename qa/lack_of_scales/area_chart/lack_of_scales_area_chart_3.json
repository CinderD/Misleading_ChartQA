    "A": "Company B appears to have about 1.4 times the market share of Company A based on the visual height.",
    "B": "Company B shows approximately 1.2 times the market share of Company A from the chart area.",
    "C": "Company B looks roughly 1.6 times larger than Company A judging from the visual proportion.",
    "D": "Cannot determine the exact ratio between Company B and Company A without Y-axis scales to verify the relative proportions."

  "task": "Data Interpretation",
      "explanation": "The chart displays market share distribution with an area chart, but provides no Y-axis scales or numerical labels. While the visual data clearly shows Company B has a larger area than Company A, without knowing the actual scale values or whether the Y-axis uses a linear, logarithmic, or reversed scale, it is impossible to determine the exact ratio between their market shares. Visual estimation of relative proportions without proper scales is unreliable for accurate market analysis.",

  "question": "What is the pattern of growth acceleration across quarters?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Growth accelerates at a consistent rate, with each quarter showing incremental increases.",
    "B": "Growth accelerates rapidly in Q3 and Q4, indicating exponential growth pattern.",
    "C": "Growth shows a linear pattern with steady, uniform increases across all quarters.",
    "D": "Cannot determine the exact acceleration pattern without Y-axis scales to verify the magnitude of changes."

      "explanation": "The chart displays quarterly growth data with an area chart, but provides no Y-axis scales or numerical labels. While the visual data shows increasing area heights from Q1 to Q4, without knowing the actual scale values or whether the Y-axis uses a linear, logarithmic, or reversed scale, it is impossible to determine the true pattern of growth acceleration. Visual estimation of acceleration patterns without proper scales is unreliable for accurate growth analysis."

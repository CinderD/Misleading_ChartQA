    "A": "Organic traffic is about 1.4 times higher than Direct traffic.",
    "B": "Organic shows approximately 1.6 times the traffic of Direct.",
    "C": "Organic is roughly 1.3 times better than Direct.",
    "D": "Cannot determine the exact ratio between Organic and Direct traffic without Y-axis scales to verify the relative volumes."

  "task": "Data Interpretation",
      "explanation": "The chart displays website traffic sources with a bar chart, but provides no Y-axis scales or numerical labels. While the visual data clearly shows Organic has a taller bar than Direct, without knowing the actual scale values or whether the Y-axis uses a linear, logarithmic, or reversed scale, it is impossible to determine the exact ratio between their traffic volumes. Visual estimation of relative proportions without proper scales is unreliable for accurate traffic analysis.",

  "question": "What is the budget distribution pattern across categories?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Budget shows a clear hierarchy with Operations receiving the most, followed by Marketing, R&D, IT, and HR.",
    "B": "The distribution is relatively balanced with most categories receiving similar allocations except HR.",
    "C": "Budget displays a bimodal pattern with high-budget categories (Operations, Marketing) and low-budget categories (HR, IT).",
    "D": "Cannot determine the exact budget distribution pattern without Y-axis scales to verify the relative allocations."

  "task": "Data Interpretation",
      "explanation": "The chart displays monthly budget allocation with a bar chart, but provides no Y-axis scales or numerical labels. While the visual data shows varying bar heights across categories, without knowing the actual scale values or whether the Y-axis uses a linear, logarithmic, or reversed scale, it is impossible to determine the true budget distribution pattern and relative allocations. Visual estimation of distribution patterns without proper scales is unreliable for accurate budget analysis.",

  "question": "What is the energy consumption trend pattern from January to August?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Energy consumption shows a clear seasonal pattern with peak usage in summer months.",
    "B": "The trend is relatively stable with only minor fluctuations throughout the period.",
    "C": "Consumption displays a declining pattern with consistent reduction over time.",
    "D": "Cannot determine the exact consumption trend pattern without Y-axis scales to verify the magnitude of changes."

  "task": "Data Interpretation",
      "explanation": "The chart displays energy consumption trend with a line chart, but provides no Y-axis scales or numerical labels. While the visual data shows varying line heights across months, without knowing the actual scale values or whether the Y-axis uses a linear, logarithmic, or reversed scale, it is impossible to determine the true pattern and magnitude of consumption changes. Visual estimation of trend patterns without proper scales is unreliable for accurate energy analysis.",

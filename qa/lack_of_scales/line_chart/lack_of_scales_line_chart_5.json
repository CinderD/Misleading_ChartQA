  "explanation": "The chart displays customer satisfaction trend with a line chart, but provides no Y-axis scales or numerical labels. While the visual data shows an upward trend in the line, without knowing the actual scale values or whether the Y-axis uses a linear, logarithmic, or reversed scale, it is impossible to determine the true pattern and magnitude of satisfaction improvements. Visual estimation of improvement patterns without proper scales is unreliable for accurate customer analysis."

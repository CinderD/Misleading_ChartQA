  "question": "According to the chart, how does the number of concert tickets sold on Aug 11 compare as a proportion to those sold on Aug 9?",

  "explanation": "The Y-axis scale starts at a higher number, which visually shrinks the representation of the tickets sold on Aug 11. Despite this, Aug 11 tickets sold (20,000) are actually 80% of those sold on Aug 9 (25,000). Visually, they appear much lower due to scale manipulation, thus misleading the viewer into believing the difference is greater than it actually is."

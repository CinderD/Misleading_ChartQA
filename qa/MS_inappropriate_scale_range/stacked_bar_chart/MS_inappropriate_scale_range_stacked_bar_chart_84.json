    "C": "Reference books had the highest volume",

  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart uses an inappropriate scale range (1000-3200) that starts well above zero, making it difficult to accurately compare the relative borrowing volumes. While Fiction books do have the highest volume (1400), the truncated scale makes Non-fiction books appear to have the largest volume, potentially misleading viewers about the actual differences between categories."

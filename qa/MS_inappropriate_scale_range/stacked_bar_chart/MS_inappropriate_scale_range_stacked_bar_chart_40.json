    "A": "Lunch service had the highest total revenue",
    "B": "Dinner service had the highest total revenue",
    "C": "Takeout service had the highest total revenue",
    "D": "Cannot be determined due to scale issues"

  "chartType": "stacked_bar_chart",
  "task": "Identify Values",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart uses an inappropriate scale range (1500-8000) that starts well above zero, making it difficult to accurately compare the relative revenue of different service types. While Lunch service does have the highest total revenue ($12,000), the truncated scale makes Dinner service appear to have a similar volume, potentially misleading viewers about the actual differences between service types."

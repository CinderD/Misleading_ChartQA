  "chartType": "choropleth_map",
  "task": "Make Comparisons",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The maps use the same scale ranges for urban (10-100+) and rural (10-100+) areas, making direct comparison possible but misleading. Urban areas appear more uniform because most fall into the 'High' category (100+), while rural areas show more color variation due to their lower actual values. However, this is due to inappropriate scale ranges rather than actual variation."

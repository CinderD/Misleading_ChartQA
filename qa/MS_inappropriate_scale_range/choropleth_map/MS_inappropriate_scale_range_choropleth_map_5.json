  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The maps use the same scale ranges for per student (11k-13k+) and per school (11k-13k+) spending, making direct comparison possible but misleading. Per school spending appears more uniform because most fall into the 'High' category (13k+), while per student spending shows more color variation due to their lower actual values. However, this is due to inappropriate scale ranges rather than actual variation."

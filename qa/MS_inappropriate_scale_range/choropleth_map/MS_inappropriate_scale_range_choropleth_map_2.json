  "options": {
    "A": "Summer shows more variation",
    "B": "Winter shows more variation",
    "C": "Both seasons show similar variation",
    "D": "The maps cannot be compared due to different scales"

  "misleader": "MS_inappropriate_scale_range",
  "chartType": "choropleth_map",
  "task": "Make Comparisons",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The maps use different temperature scales: summer (75-85째F+) vs winter (20-50째F+). Winter appears to show more color variation because the scale range is wider (30째F range vs 10째F range), but this is due to inappropriate scale ranges rather than actual temperature variation. The scales make direct comparison impossible."

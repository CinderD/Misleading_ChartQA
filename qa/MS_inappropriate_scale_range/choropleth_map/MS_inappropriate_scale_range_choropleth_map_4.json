  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The maps use the same scale ranges for violent (400-800+) and property (400-800+) crimes, making direct comparison possible but misleading. Violent crimes appear more uniform because most fall into the 'High' category (800+), while property crimes show more color variation due to their lower actual values. However, this is due to inappropriate scale ranges rather than actual variation."

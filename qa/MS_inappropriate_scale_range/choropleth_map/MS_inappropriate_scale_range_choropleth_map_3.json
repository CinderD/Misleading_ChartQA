  "chartType": "choropleth_map",
  "task": "Make Comparisons",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The maps use the same scale ranges for wet (10-100+) and dry (10-100+) regions, making direct comparison possible but misleading. Wet regions appear more uniform because most fall into the 'High' category (100+), while dry regions show more color variation due to their lower actual values. However, this is due to inappropriate scale ranges rather than actual variation."

  "question": "The chart shows the percentage of samples in which Bacteria Z was detected from 1970 to 2020 (out of a possible 0–100%). What is the most appropriate conclusion from the observed changes in value over the past 50 years?",
  "options": {
    "A": "There was a large surge in detection rates",
    "B": "There was a modest upward trend within a narrow band",
    "C": "The rate stayed exactly the same",
    "D": "The trend cannot be inferred at all"

  "explanation": "The y-axis uses a very tight range (≈15.0–16.4%) instead of a more informative 0–100% scale, visually exaggerating variability. The actual change is about 1.4 percentage points over decades, which is modest, not a large surge."

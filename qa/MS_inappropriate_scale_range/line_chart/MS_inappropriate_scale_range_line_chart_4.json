    "A": "There was a dramatic improvement in student performance",
    "B": "There was a steady but modest improvement over time",

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The y-axis uses a very narrow range (78–82) instead of the full 0–100 scale, making the 3-point improvement appear much more dramatic than it actually is. A 1.75-point improvement on a 100-point scale represents only a modest 2% increase over 10 years."

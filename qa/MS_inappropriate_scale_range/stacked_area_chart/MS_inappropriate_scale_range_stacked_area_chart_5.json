  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The Y-axis scale starts at 18 instead of 0, which visually exaggerates the proportion of Neutral satisfaction relative to Very Satisfied. While Neutral satisfaction is actually about 55% of Very Satisfied, the truncated scale makes it appear closer to 110%."

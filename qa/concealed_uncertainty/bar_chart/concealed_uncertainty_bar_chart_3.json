  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "While New York currently has the highest preference score (42.5%), the chart shows results as of Phase 1, but the research project concludes in Phase 3. The remaining research phases could significantly change the results, making it premature to choose a store location. The concealed uncertainty lies in the incomplete research process that is not reflected in the chart."

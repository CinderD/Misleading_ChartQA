    "B": "Sales will definitely be below $180,000",
    "C": "The trend line suggests sales will be $190,000",
    "D": "Cannot be determined due to data variability"

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "While the trend line shows a positive correlation between advertising budget and sales, the data only goes up to $25,000. Extrapolating to $50,000 involves significant uncertainty given the fact that $50,000 is way beyond the observed range."

    "C": "The trend line suggests the score will be 92",
    "D": "Cannot be determined due to data variability"

  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "While the trend line shows a positive correlation, the data plateaus around 38 hours and shows some decline after that. Extrapolating to 60 hours involves uncertainty, and the word 'definitely' in option A and B implies certainty that cannot be guaranteed given the variability in the data and the plateau effect shown."

  "options": {
    "A": "Water sales will definitely be less than 100 bottles",
    "B": "Water sales will likely be around 200 bottles",
    "C": "The trend line suggests sales will be 50 bottles",
    "D": "Cannot be determined due to data variability"

  "explanation": "While the trend line suggests increasing water sales with temperature, the data shows significant variability and only goes up to 255°F. Extrapolating to 300°F involves uncertainty, and the word 'definitely' in option A implies certainty that cannot be guaranteed given the scatter in the data. The concealed uncertainty lies in the variability around the trend line and the act of extrapolation beyond the observed data range."

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "This area chart inappropriately connects discrete brand categories with continuous area encoding. Brands are independent, unrelated entities with no inherent sequential order or continuous relationship. The area visualization falsely implies a smooth transition or trend between brands, suggesting that market share changes gradually from one brand to the next, which is conceptually incorrect. Each brand should be treated as a separate category, making a bar chart more appropriate for this comparison."

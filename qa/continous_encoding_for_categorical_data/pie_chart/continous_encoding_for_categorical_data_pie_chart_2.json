  "options": {
    "A": "The color intensity represents the musical preference level of each genre.",

  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "This pie chart uses continuous color encoding (orange gradient) for categorical music genre data. Music genres like Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classical, Hip Hop, Country, and Electronic are distinct, independent categories with no inherent order or continuous relationship that would justify a color gradient. The continuous color scale misleadingly suggests that darker colors represent higher musical complexity, sophistication, or some progressive relationship between genres, when in reality these are simply different categorical divisions of musical preferences. Each music genre should use distinct, unordered colors to avoid implying false relationships or hierarchies between the categories."

  "options": {
    "A": "Rainfall of around 140 mm is likely to result in roughly double the crop yield compared to rainfall of around 90 mm.",
    "B": "There is a generally positive relationship between rainfall and yield.",
    "C": "Yields decrease as rainfall increases.",
    "D": "There is no relationship at all."

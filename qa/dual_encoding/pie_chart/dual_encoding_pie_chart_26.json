    "A": "The Education budget is higher than the combined budgets for Healthcare and Infrastructure.",
    "B": "The Healthcare category has the lowest budget allocation.",
    "C": "The Infrastructure budget is larger than the Safety Funding budget.",
    "D": "The allocation for Safety and Healthcare combined exceeds that for Education."

  "correctAnswer": "D",
  "wrongDueToMisleaderAnswer": "A",
  "misleader": "dual_encoding",
  "chartType": "pie_chart",
  "task": "Data Comparison",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart displays an Education budget of 35%, which is less than the combined total for Healthcare (25%) and Infrastructure (20%), summing up to 45%. Option A could mislead due to the dual encoding technique, where the angle and area discrepancy makes Education appear larger relative to other categories."

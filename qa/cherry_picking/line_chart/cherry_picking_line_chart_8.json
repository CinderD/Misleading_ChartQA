  "explanation": "While the visible data shows a clear pattern of growth (2000-2004) followed by decline (2005), this cherry-picked 6-year window cannot reliably indicate market behavior across the full 15-year period (1995-2010). Other periods within this timeframe could show significantly different patterns that would alter our understanding of long-term market trends."

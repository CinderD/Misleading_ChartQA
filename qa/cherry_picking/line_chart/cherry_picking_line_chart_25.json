    "B": "Economic conditions show persistent decline across the entire timeframe.",

  "explanation": "While the visible data shows an accelerating upward trend from 2000-2005, this cherry-picked 6-year window cannot reliably indicate economic behavior across the full 15-year period (1995-2010). Other periods within this timeframe could show significantly different patterns that would alter our understanding of long-term economic trends."

    "A": "The data reveals a clear cyclical pattern: growth followed by decline, indicating predictable market cycles.",
    "B": "Market performance shows consistent decline throughout the four-decade period.",
    "C": "The market exhibits random behavior with no discernible long-term pattern.",

  "explanation": "While the visible data shows a pattern of rising prices (1964-1971) followed by declining prices (1980-1983), this cherry-picked sample covers only 12 years out of a 40-year period. The majority of years (1972-1979, 1984-2000) are omitted, making it unreliable for understanding long-term market trends.",

  "explanation": "While the visible data shows a clear upward trend from 1995-2002, this cherry-picked 8-year window cannot reliably indicate market behavior across the full 20-year period (1990-2010). Other periods within this timeframe could show different patterns that would significantly alter our understanding of long-term market trends."

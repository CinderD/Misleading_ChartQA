  "question": "Can we generalize this holiday season performance to predict year-round advertising effectiveness?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Yes, the strong growth pattern indicates year-round effectiveness.",
    "B": "No, the holiday season data here is not sorted in chronological (month) order.",
    "C": "Yes, the consistent upward trend suggests universal success.",
    "D": "No, we need non-holiday season data for accurate year-round assessment."

  "misleader": "cherry_picking",

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart only shows data for five months during the holiday season (October to February), representing a selective subset of the complete dataset. While the visible data points suggest strong growth during this peak period, this cherry-picked sample cannot reliably indicate year-round advertising effectiveness. The missing data from non-holiday months could reveal very different performance patterns, as holiday seasons typically show inflated sales that are not representative of regular business periods."

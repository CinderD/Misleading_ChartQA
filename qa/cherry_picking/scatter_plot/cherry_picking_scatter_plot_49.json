  "options": {
    "A": "Early-year shows an optimal spending range around $60K that maximizes sales performance.",
    "B": "Marketing spend has no relationship with sales performance in early-year periods.",
    "C": "Higher marketing spend always leads to higher sales in early-year periods.",
    "D": "We need data from all seasons to determine if this pattern holds year-round."

  "task": "Infer Trends",
  "explanation": "The chart shows an inverted U-shape where sales peak at around $60K spend ($120K sales) and decline with both lower and higher spending. This suggests an optimal spending range for early-year periods. However, this cherry-picked data only shows January-May, hiding potentially different patterns in summer, fall, or winter that might show different optimal spending levels or no optimal point at all.",

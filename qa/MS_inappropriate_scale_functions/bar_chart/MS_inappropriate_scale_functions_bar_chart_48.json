  "explanation": "The scale function applied to the y-axis uses an arbitrary transformation, distorting the perceived proportional difference between the bar heights. Although Candidate B's votes (800) are 400% of Candidate A's votes (200), the non-linear scale makes the bar for Candidate A appear much bigger, leading to the incorrect interpretation that B's votes are closer to 200% of A's votes."

    "A": "12.5%",
    "B": "25%",
    "C": "50%",
    "D": "75%"

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The scaling function applied to the y-axis uses an arbitrary transformation, distorting the perceived proportional difference between the bar heights. Candidate A's votes are 12.5% of Candidate B's votes, but the non-linear scale makes the bar for Candidate A appear much higher, potentially leading to the incorrect interpretation that A's votes are 50% of B's."

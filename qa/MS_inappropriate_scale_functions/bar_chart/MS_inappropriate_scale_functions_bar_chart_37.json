  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The scale function applied to the y-axis uses an arbitrary transformation, distorting the perceived proportional difference between the bar heights. Although Candidate A's votes are 12.5% of Candidate B's votes, the non-linear scale makes the bar for Candidate A appear much bigger, leading to the incorrect interpretation that A's votes are closer to 33% of B's votes."

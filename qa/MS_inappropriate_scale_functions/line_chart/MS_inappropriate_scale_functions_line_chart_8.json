    "C": "Both periods show equal increase",

  "ifLabelled": "False",
  "explanation": "The chart uses a logarithmic y-scale (base 2), which visually expands lower values relative to higher values. This makes the 2000-2003 period appear steeper, even though the actual increase is larger during 2005-2008 (1M vs 1.1M)."
